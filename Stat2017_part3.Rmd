## Analysis of variance
- Regression models predict a quantitative response variable from quantitative predictor variables.
- When factors are included as explanatory variables, our focus usually shifts from prediction to understanding group differences, and the methodology is referred to as analysis of variance (ANOVA) .

## aov() {.smaller}
**aov(*formula*, data=*dataframe*)**

Design | Formula
------------------------ | --------------------------
One-way ANOVA | y ~ A
One-way ANCOVA with 1 covariate | y ~ x + A
Two-way factorial ANOVA | y ~ A * B
Two-way factorial ANCOVA with 2 covariates | y ~ x1 + x2 + A * B
Randomized block | y ~ B + A (where B is a blocking factor)
One-way within-groups ANOVA | y ~ A + Error(Subject/A)
Repeated measures ANOVA with 1 within-groups factor (W) and 1 between-groups factor (B) | y ~ B * W + Error(Subject/W)

## One-way ANOVA {.smaller}
In a one-way ANOVA , you’re interested in comparing the dependent variable means of two or more groups defined by a categorical grouping factor.
```{r}
library(multcomp)
attach(cholesterol)
table(trt)
head(response)
```

***
```{r}
aggregate(response, by=list(trt), FUN=mean)
aggregate(response, by=list(trt), FUN=sd)
```

***
```{r}
fit <- aov(response ~ trt)
summary(fit)
```

***
```{r}
library(gplots)
plotmeans(response ~ trt, xlab="Treatment", ylab="Response",
          main="Mean Plot\nwith 95% CI")
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
detach(cholesterol)
```

## *Multiple comparisons* {.smaller}
The ANOVA F test for treatment tells you that the five drug regimens aren’t equally effective, but it doesn’t tell you which treatments differ from one another. You can use **TukeyHSD()** function to test all pairwise differences between group means.
```{r}
TukeyHSD(fit)
```

## Assessing the normality assumption {.smaller}
```{r}
library(car)
qqPlot(lm(response ~ trt, data=cholesterol), simulate=TRUE, main="Q-Q Plot", labels=FALSE)
```

## Assessing equality of variances {.smaller}
```{r}
bartlett.test(response ~ trt, data=cholesterol)
```
Bartlett’s test indicates that the variances in the five groups don’t differ significantly.

## Test for outliers
```{r}
library(car)
outlierTest(fit)
```

## One-way ANCOVA {.smaller}
A one-way analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) extends the one-way ANOVA to include one or more quantitative covariates.
```{r}
data(litter, package="multcomp")
attach(litter)
table(dose)
```

```{r}
head(weight)
```

```{r}
head(gesttime)
```

***
```{r}
aggregate(weight, by=list(dose), FUN=mean)
```

```{r}
aggregate(weight, by=list(dose), FUN=sd)
```

***
```{r}
fit <- aov(weight ~ gesttime + dose)
summary(fit)
```
- The ANCOVA F tests indicate that (a) gestation time was related to birth weight, and (b) drug dosage was related to birth weight after controlling for gestation time. 
- The mean birth weight isn’t the same for each of the drug dosages, after controlling for gestation time.

***
Because you’re using a covariate, you may want to obtain adjusted group means — that is, the group means obtained after partialing out the effects of the covariate.
```{r}
library(effects)
effect("dose", fit)
```

***
- As with the one-way ANOVA example, the F test for dose indicates that the treatments don’t have the same mean birth weight, but it doesn’t tell you which means differ from one another. 
- You can use the multiple comparison procedures provided by the multcomp package to compute all pairwise mean comparisons.
```{r}
library(multcomp)
contrast <- rbind("no drug vs. drug" = c(3, -1, -1, -1))
```
- The contrast c(3, -1, -1, -1) specifies a comparison of the first group with the average of the other three.

***
```{r}
summary(glht(fit, linfct=mcp(dose=contrast)))
```

## Assessing test assumptions
ANCOVA designs make the same normality and homogeneity of variance assumptions described for ANOVA designs, and you can test these assumptions using the same procedures described above.

## Two-way factorial ANOVA {.smaller}
In a two-way factorial ANOVA, subjects are assigned to groups that are formed from the cross-classification of two factors.
```{r}
attach(ToothGrowth)
head(supp)
```

```{r}
head(dose)
```

```{r}
table(supp, dose)
```

***
```{r}
aggregate(len, by=list(supp, dose), FUN=mean)
```

```{r}
aggregate(len, by=list(supp, dose), FUN=sd)
```

***
```{r}
dose <- factor(dose)
fit <- aov(len ~ supp*dose)
summary(fit)
```

The ANOVA table indicates that both main effects (*supp* and *dose*) and the interaction between these factors are significant.

***
```{r}
library(HH)
interaction2wt(len~supp*dose)
```

## Repeated measures ANOVA
In repeated measures ANOVA, subjects are measured more than once. We focuses on a repeated measures ANOVA with one within-groups and one between-groups factor (a common design).
```{r}
CO2$conc <- factor(CO2$conc)
w1b1 <- subset(CO2, Treatment=='chilled')
head(w1b1)
```

***
```{r}
fit <- aov(uptake ~ conc*Type + Error(Plant/(conc)), w1b1)
summary(fit)
```

***
```{r}
par(las=2)
par(mar=c(10,4,4,2))
with(w1b1, interaction.plot(conc, Type, uptake, type="b", 
                            col=c("red","blue"), pch=c(16,18),
                            main="Interaction Plot for Plant Type and Concentration"))
```

***
```{r, out.width = "500px", fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("qrcode.jpg")
```
