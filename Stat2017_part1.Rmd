## Descriptive statistics

```{r}
myvars <- c('mpg', 'hp', 'wt')
summary(mtcars[myvars])
```

The **summary()** function provides the minimum, maximum, quartiles, and mean for numerical variables and frequencies for factors and logical vectors.

***
```{r}
library(pastecs)
myvars <- c('mpg', 'hp', 'wt')
stat.desc(mtcars[myvars])
```

## *Descriptive statistics by group*
```{r}
myvars <- c('mpg', 'hp', 'wt')
aggregate(mtcars[myvars], by=list(am=mtcars$am), mean)
aggregate(mtcars[myvars], by=list(am=mtcars$am), sd)
```
***
```{r}
myvars <- c('mpg', 'hp', 'wt')
by(mtcars[myvars], mtcars$am, summary)
```

## Frequency and contingency tables
```{r}
library(vcd)
head(Arthritis)
```

## *ONE-WAY TABLES*
```{r}
mytable <- table(Arthritis$Improved)
mytable
prop.table(mytable)
```

## *TWO-WAY TABLES*
```{r}
mytable <- table(Arthritis$Treatment, Arthritis$Improved)
mytable
prop.table(mytable, 1)
```

## **MULTIDIMENSIONAL TABLES**
```{r}
mytable <- xtabs(~ Treatment+Improved+Sex, data = Arthritis)
ftable(mytable)
```

## Tests of independence
- Chi-square test
- Fisher's exact test
- Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test

## Chi-square test {.smaller}
```{r}
mytable <- xtabs(~Treatment+Improved, data=Arthritis)
chisq.test(mytable)
```

```{r}
mytable <- xtabs(~Improved+Sex, data=Arthritis)
chisq.test(mytable)
```

## Fisher's exact test {.smaller}
```{r}
mytable <- xtabs(~Treatment+Improved, data=Arthritis)
fisher.test(mytable)
```

```{r}
mytable <- xtabs(~Improved+Sex, data=Arthritis)
fisher.test(mytable)
```

## Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test {.smaller}
```{r}
mytable <- xtabs(~Treatment+Improved+Sex, data=Arthritis)
mantelhaen.test(mytable)
```
- The test assumes that there's no **three-way interaction** (*Treatment* and *Improved* variables are independent within each level for *Sex*). 
- The results suggest that treatment received and the improvement reported aren't independent with each level of *Sex*.

## Measures of association
```{r}
library(vcd)
mytable <- xtabs(~Treatment+Improved, data=Arthritis)
assocstats(mytable)
```

## Correlations
- Correlation coefficients are used to describe relationships among quantitative variables. 
- The sign indicates the direction of the relationship, and the magnitude indicates the strength of the relationship.

## Types of correlations
- **Pearson** correlation assesses the degree of **linear** relationship between two quantitative variables.
- **Spearman** correlation assesses the degree of relationship between two rank-ordered variables.

***
```{r}
states <- state.x77[, 1:6]
head(states)
```

***
```{r}
cor(states, method = 'pearson')
```

***
```{r}
cor(states, method = 'spearman')
```

***
*You cat get the relationships between one set of variables and another:*
```{r}
x <- states[, c('Population', 'Income', 'Illiteracy', 'HS Grad')]
y <- states[,c('Life Exp', 'Murder')]
cor(x, y)
```

## Testing correlations for significance {.smaller}
The typical null hypothesis is no relationship (that is, the correlation in the population is 0).
```{r}
cor.test(states[,3], states[,5])
```
*You can test only one correlation at a time using cor.test()*

## Testing correlations for significance {.smaller}
```{r}
library(psych)
corr.test(states, use = 'complete', method = 'pearson')
```

## T-tests
- A two-group **independent t-test** can be used to test the hypothesis that the two population means are equal. Here, you assume that the two groups are **independent** and that the data is sampled from **normal** populations.

- When observations in the two groups are related, you have a dependent-groups design. A **dependent t-test** assumes that the **difference** between groups is **normally** distributed.

- If you can assume that the data are **independently** sampled from **normal** populations, you can use analysis of variance (ANOVA).

***
```{r}
library(MASS)
head(UScrime)
```

***
```{r}
t.test(Prob ~ So, data=UScrime)
```
- The default test assumes unequal variance and applies the *Welsh degrees-of-freedom modification*.

***
```{r}
with(UScrime, t.test(U1, U2, paired=TRUE))
```

## Nonparametric tests
If you're unable to meet the parametric assumptions of a t-test or ANOVA, for example, if the outcome variables are severely skewed or ordinal in nature, you can turn to nonparametric approaches.

## Comparing two groups
If the two groups are independent, you can use the **Wilcoxon rank sum test (Mann-Whitney U test)** to assess whether the observations are sampled from the same probability distribution (that is, whether the probability of obtaining higher scores is greater in one population than the other).

***
```{r}
wilcox.test(Prob ~ So, data=UScrime)
```

***
```{r}
with(UScrime, wilcox.test(U1, U2, paired = TRUE))
```

## Comparing more than two groups
- If you can't meet the assumptions of ANOVA designs, you can use nonparametric methods to evaluate group differences.

- If the groups are independent, a **Kruskal-Wallis** test provides a useful approach.

- If the groups are dependent, the **Friedman test** is more approprate.

***
```{r}
states <- data.frame(state.region, state.x77)
kruskal.test(Illiteracy ~ state.region, data = state.x77)
```
- Although you can reject the null hypothesis of no difference, the test doesn't tell you **which** regions differ significantly from each other.

- To answer this question, you could compare groups two at a time using the **Wilcoxon test**.
